# X-Plane plugin wingtoggler

This is an X-Plane XLua plane plugin.
It was born from the limitation of the flight model allowing only rather simple flap effects on a wing.

## Manual

Please see the [README.md in the XLua module](xlua-wingtoggler/scripts/wingtoggler/README.md).

*"Think positive, flaps negative"*
